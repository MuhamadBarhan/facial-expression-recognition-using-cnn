# Facial Expression Recognition using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to develop a facial expression recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately detect and classify emotions from facial images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system analyzes facial features and expressions to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality. The trained CNN model is capable of robustly identifying emotional states from facial images in real-time, facilitating applications in various domains, including entertainment, market research, education, healthcare, human-computer interaction, gaming, retail, and automotive sectors. Through its ability to interpret human emotions, the system enhances user experiences, improves service quality, and enables innovative applications across diverse industries.
